## An updated tool for uploading your Portal 2 maps to the workshop on both Windows and Linux, made with the QT UI framework

### This tool improved upon the base Portal 2 Uploader with addition al features such as:
- Custom tags.
- Multiple preview images
- Multiple preview Videos
- Workshop Visibility
- Toggleable option for PTI requirement.

### LINUX
Sadly, I haven't found a way to add the binaries for QT to the uploader, therefore QT 5.15.2 must be installed on your system to work. Sorry for the inconinience.

## This tool is open source, If you wish to compile and distribute this tool for other purposes, the code is open source under MIT license.
