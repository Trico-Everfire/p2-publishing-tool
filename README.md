## With this cross compatible uploading tool you'll be able to upload to the portal 2 workshop on both Windows and Linux, Removing VGUI entirely and opting for QT UI instead, This isnt  just a 1:1 copy. It adds a few needed features

- ### Custom tags.
- ### Multiple preview images
- ### Multiple preview Videos
- ### Workshop Visibility
- ### Toggleable option for PTI requirement.

## Currently the application is in alpha, therefor a lot of base features are missing:
- ### Image compression for images.
- ### Coop map support.
- ### Automatic Test Element Tag assignment.

## This tool is open source, If you wish to compile the uploader for your own workshop, or any other workshop, the code is open source under MIT license.
