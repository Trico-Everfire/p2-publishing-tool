## An updated tool for uploading your Portal 2 maps to the workshop on both Windows and Linux, made with the QT UI framework

### This tool improved upon the base Portal 2 Uploader with addition al features such as:
- Custom tags.
- Multiple preview images
- Multiple preview Videos
- Workshop Visibility
- Toggleable option for PTI requirement.

## This tool is open source, If you wish to compile and distribute this tool for other purposes, the code is open source under MIT license.

## The rewrite!
### I have rewritten this tool from scratch to improve upon it, the old one was unclear, bug ridden, and didn't work most of the time and nobody knew why, even I didn't until I spend a day debugging it. That shouldn't be a thing! so I rewrote it with comprehensive error handling and cleaner, self commenting code in mind!
